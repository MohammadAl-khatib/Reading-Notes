# React and Forms

## Forms

Form as a React component behaves in adifferent way than what we saw with HTML forms, all because of its initial state, it is better to use a controlled component to handle React form component.

A controlled component is the one that controls a value from user input, it is used by setting a value in the component state and give the user the power to change it with a function recalled inside `onChange`, this will give us the ability to update the value from other components and functions, this can be done with `input`, `textarea`, and `select`. For uncontrolled components like `input type="file"` another approach will be used later in this course.
