# Machine Learning Intro
Machine learning is not only about writing algorithms, actually if an algorithm tells the machine what to do exactly; then it is explicitly programmed not learned how to interact.

## Key Terminology:
1. Model: a set of patterns learned from data.
2. Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
3. Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
4. Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
5. Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
6. Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
7. Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.
 
## 3 elements for great machine learning:
 1. A skilled designer
 2. Cleaning and analyzing data
 3. Avoid overfitting

## Machine learning basic steps:
 1. Exploratory Analysis: study your dataset carefully
 2. Data Cleaning: good data is the key for good models
 3. Feature Engineering: generate new features from the old features
 4. Algorithm Selection
 5. Model Training
