A team of reserchers working for the tech giant Google conducted a research to find what makes a good team, and what doesn't.

Long story short, the indivisual sychological characteristics is not the key value in the over all performance of the team, what really matters are the norms (the undeclared habbits among team members) of the working team, the research shows that giving each member a chance to express his ideas will enhance the efficiency of team work.

Another major influence comes from the ability of team members to read the emotions and feelings of the others, the better the ability the better the results of team work, and the higher the feeling of relaxation among team members. Also, the being aware of what life challenges and difficulties of the team members will reduce the tension and increase the collaboration.
