### Wireframing



#### Wireframe: is the outline of the web page design, it consists of the fundamental shapes you will see on the screen. Example of basic elements: a box for login, company logo, an image, help for log in.

#### Wireframing can be done using hand made drawings or digital applications, in either case, the process might be simple or complicated depending on the importance and the amount of data needed in the interface.

### HTML Basics

#### Using a set of syntaxes, you can creat a web page content, and structre your page with HTML.

#### Some of the basic synaxes are:
- p for paragraph
- h1 for main header
- ul for unordered list
- ol for ordered list

##### Remember: HTML is a markdown language, you need to use tags to wrire a syntax.

### Semantics
#### Semantics is to know the function a specific piece of code has, an example is <h1> in Html represents a top level head line while <h2> a little bit lower level of importance.
