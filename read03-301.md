# Passing Functions as Props

## Lists

Here we will use `map` to iterate over the elements of an array and produce a list, or actually, creat a component that renders a list with multiple elements, something similar to this:

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgKxebexbVc/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="html list" width="450" height = '300'/>

In order to be able to render multiple HTML elements (like `li`s of  `ol` or `ul`), loops will serve as a handy tool, the steps needed to complete the component are as follows:

1. Create a component that takes data from a parent element as props.
2. Create a variable that holds the list (here use `map`).
3. The return of the previous `map` will be `li` with needed data.
4. The component now shall return the full list (variable in step 2) as a `ul`.
5. Finally, the component shall be injected in ReactDOM.

## Keys

Keys help React trace changes of an item, id and index can be used as keys, make sure where to define a key and make it unique, you can see example for where and where not to use keys and how to ensure it is unique [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html);

## The Spread Operator `...`

>The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments.
>
> - Dr. Derek Austin

Spread operators can be used for:

**Copying an array**

**Concatenating arrays**

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

To pass fucntions between components follow the following steps:

1. Define the function in parent component.

2. Pass the function as aprop to the child component.

In our video a function called increment was used to add 1 to the count when a button is clicked.
