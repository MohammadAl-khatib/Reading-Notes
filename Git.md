# Git
A version control system (vcs) that allows you to keep a record of what is happening with your documents, and to visit the various versions that you, or your authorized colleagues, have been working on.

There are 3 types of VCS:

1.	Local version control: for your own device
2.	Centralized version control: in which a group of people will be working on a common server to modify their files.
3.	Distributed Version Control: enables the use of various simultaneous workflows and preventing the risk single point failure of the server.

In order to make sure that the changes you did are saved on git, you must do ACP (Add – Commit – Push), you will be dealing with remote repositories sometimes, Git provides a set of commands to view and add to your remote repositories.
