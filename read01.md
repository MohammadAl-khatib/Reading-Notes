# Learning Markdown

In every website, written blog, or anywhere you will deal with texts, you will need an easy way to format and style your work, and that is what the markdown syntax will help you do.

The easier the way of styling, the more it will be practical, with markdown, you only need to add some symbols to your text to style it and format it. The most popular symbols are # for headers, put your text between * text * for *italic* (without spaces), and between ** text ** for **bold** (without spaces). other symbols have other functions, You can see how easy it is.

GitHub.com has its own touch on markup as well, there you will find syntax for task lists, tables, referencing, mentioning, â€¦etc. you can view some of these on [GitHub Guides]( https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
