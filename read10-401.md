# Stacks and Queues
A stack is a set of nodes in which each node refrences the next node, `pushing` to stack means to add to it, while `popping` removes a node from the stack, `peek` in turn calls the `top` node in the stack.

### Push
Pushing is always O(1) operation, because it just creates a new node and assign it as top node, the next to this new node is the old top

### Pop
Also an O(1), keep in mind that pop needs to return the popped node, so you have to store it before popping it, this is done by assiging the top to the next of current top, and putiing `null` as next of current (old) top.

### Queue
It is the opposit (in terms of ordering) to stacks, it has its own terminology:

- Enqueue : adding to queue
- Dequeue : removing from queue
- Front : fisrt added node
- Rear: last added node
