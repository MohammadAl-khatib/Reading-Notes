# Linear Regressions
Is the prediction of how two variables are related to each other, in Python you need a data frame to start working on linear regression, eighther it is already there, or you need to create your own data frame using `Pandas`, assuming data frame is ready and contains the required parameters; do the following steps to have a linear regression model:

1. Import `LinearRegression` from `sk.linear_model`
2. Drop any value that you don't want to appear on the x-axis
3. Store linear regression inside a variable:
    - variable = LinearRegression()
    - Linear regression contains some important functions
        -  `lm.fit()` -> fits a linear model
        - `lm.predict()` -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
        - `lm.score()` -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2)
        - `.coef_` gives the coefficients
        - `.intercept_` gives the estimated intercepts.
4. Use `lm.fit()`, the first argument is the x-axis data, the second is the y-axis data
5. Use `LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, normalize=False)`
6. Construct a data frame that contains features and estimated coefficients
7. Notice any feature that has a high estimated coefficient
8. Use `plot` to plot that feature against the y-axis of step 4
