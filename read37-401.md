## ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview

### Variable declaration
ES6 introduced the `let` which allows to a block scope declaration of the varibles unlike `var` which will declare a variable globally or locally to the entire function regardless of any inner scopes declared (i.e. a variable declared using `var` will be accessed ant where in the glabal scope or inside the function).

ES6 also introduced the `const` keyword, which cannot be redeclared or reassigned, but is not immutable, meaning, if you store an object, you may edit this object's content.

### Arrow function syntax
A shorter way of declaring functions, takes the formula of parameters => expression, it can't be used as method, or constructor, does not have prototype, and using `this` will refer to the global scope itself.

### Template literals
Using the ${variable name} will let you call varibles inside strings, multi line strings also can be written but whitespace must be taken into consideration.

### Method definition shorthand
Inside classes there is no need to write `function` to declare a method.

### Key/property shorthand
Calling variables inside an object is enough if you want to tur them to properties.

### Classes/constructor functions
`class` is used to declare a class, `constructor` is used to set object properties, and `extends` for inherting (making a subclass of a class)

## React
React is a component library based on JS in which `JSX` is used to write HTML component inside JavaScript synatx and you can also use`{}` to write expressions inside HTML, JSX also helps preventing injection attacks by escaping any embedded values before rendering them.
