## Control Flow
When using JavaScript, the default way for reading your code is from top to bottom, but sometime you may want to manipulate this default, to do so, you can use functions and loops and if statements.

Functions (when declared but not when expressed) will make JavaScript skip the code under and search for the function and execute it, after that the program will continue from where it ended firstly.

For loops and if statements are condition dependant syntaxes, meaning whenever the condition is met, the staement will skip executing the syntax inside.

## Functions
Functions are block of codes that you can call where ever you need, functions can be declared or expressed. *Declaring a functions makes it possible to use it anywhere in the file, while expressing a function will make possible to call it only after defining it*.

#### Why to use functions?
1. Save Time
2. Shorter code
3. Easier to call

#### How to use functions

The general form of defining a function is as follows

As you can see, calling a function is essential to show the results.

Nested functions can be used also, *but keep in mind that the variable of the inner function are only used for it and cannot be recognised by either the outer function or by the file*.

## Operators

Operators can be divided into:
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

each operator type deals with specific type of data and does different task, you can read more in details in the references below.
