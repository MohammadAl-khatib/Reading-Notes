# FileIO & Exceptions

## Read & Write Files in Python

File is a container for data, most modern files are composed of 3 main parts:
- Header : contains metadata
- Data
- Footer: a sign for the end of file

For opening a file use `open(file path)`, it is important to close the file after finishing working on it, this can be ensured by using `try` and `finally` or using `with open()`.

`open` built in function may have some arguments optionally after the path, which define the way you open the file with, here is a quick description of these arguments:

Argument | Description
------------ | -------------
`r` | read only (the default value)
`w` | writing
`b` | binary mode

**There are 3 types of files:**

1. Text Files
2. Buffered Binary Files
3. Raw File

You can read and write to a file, for detailed coding visit [this page](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)

## Exceptions in Python
Exceptions result from errors after parsing syntactically right, there are differnt [types of errors](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) in Python.

Using `try` and `except` you can target what happens when a specific exception takes place by defining the exception name after except, or leave it empty to target any exception in `try` block.

This `try` and `except` can be followed by `else` for execution in case of no errors happend in `try` block, also `finally` can be used to execute a block of code no matter what happens during the execution of `try` block.
