## Text
As with regular texts in a newspaper or a word documents, texts in a web page consists of headings and paragraphs, and it may have some sort of editing like using **bold** text, or *inclined* text. In addition emphasis and "quote".

In order to define and edit text with HTML, tags are used, here is a list of the most common tags used with text:
Tag | Function
------------ | -------------
`<h1>`...`<h6>` | from top level to lowest level headings
`<b>` | for **bold** text
`<i>` | for *italic* text
`<sup>` | for superscripting text
`<sub>` | for subscripting text
`</br>` | a line break
`</hr>` | a horizontal line
`<abbr>`| for abbreviation, used with title attribute
`<ins>`and `<del>`| for inserted and deleted texts

## Introducing CSS
Cascading style sheets (CSS) are used to control the design and appeaarance of a web page, you have to select element / elements using selectors i.e ID; classes; or other selectors, choose a property name and assign a value for it.

There are 3 types of CSS:

1- Inline CSS: in which the property is modified for an element in its tag

2- Internal CSS: here the elements are selected and modified in the head of the HTML page

3- External CSS: the page will have its design stored in a seprate file linked to it

This is the best way of apllying CSS, it provides the ability to share the file to other pages saving time of repeating code.

### Inheritance
Some properties are inherited (applied to child elements), some are not.
