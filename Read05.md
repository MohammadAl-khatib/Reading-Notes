# Expressions and Operators
&nbsp;
## Operators
 An operator is a symbol or set of symbols that perform a specific operation like adding, subtracting, comparing, incremining, and assigning values. operators in JavaScript can be classified into 3 types (based on number of operands):

 1. Uniray operators, in which a single operand (anything with value) is needed to complete the operation like increminting e.g. 1++
 2. Binary operators, here two operands are needed like summation and multiplication and comparison
 3. Ternary operator, JavaScript has only one ternary operator which is the conditional operator i.e. condition ? val1 : val2
&nbsp;
Another famous classification for operators is shown in the image below

Some operators and their functions

Operator | Operation | Example | Result
------------ | -------------
`+` | summation | 10 `+` 124 | 134
`*` | multiplication | x`*`5 | multiplies the value of x by 5
`/` | multiplication | x`/`5 | divides the value of x by 5
`>` |  check if  greater than | age `<` 18 | checks if the value of age is less than 18
`<=` | check if less or equal | 12 `<=` 7 | false
`=` | assign value | x`=`5 | stores 5 on var x

## Loops
Loops are used to repeat a code or set of codes without the need to rewrite them, here the syntax of for and while loop:

1. for loop:
for (var i = 0; i < number; i++) 
{
  syntax
} here you control the number of repitions

2. while (i < number) 
{
  syntax
} here the loop will repeat until the conditoin is met
