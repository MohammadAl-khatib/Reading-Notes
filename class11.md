## Images
We talked earlier about images in genera - [check link](https://mohammadal-khatib.github.io/Reading-Notes/class05)-, here we are goin to talk about sizing, positioning, and images as backgrounds.

#### Sizing Images
Selecting the size of image will enhance the loading of a web page, image size can be defined be setting the `<width>` and `<height>` properties eighther in pixels (px) or a percentage of its containing element (say 50%).

#### Psitioning of Images
Images are inline elements by default, their position can be controlled by `<float>`, to center image set `<margin>` to auto, changing the `<display>` to block will make the image appear on a single line.

#### Images as Backgrounds
To set an image as a background, after selecting the element you want the image to be set as its background, select `background` property and enter the URL of the background in need, background images can be repeated and positioned as well.
