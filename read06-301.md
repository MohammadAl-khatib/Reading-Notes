**Node.js** is a runtime designed using Chrome's V8 engine, which in turn is an editable library created by Google that implements JS code.

## Install Node.js

You can check your node version using `node -v`, for me it shows v14.17.3, if nothing appears on screen then consider downloading from [their official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), a common handy tool when dealing with node is the node package manager `npm` which manages the installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing of packages in your application, to check npm version use `npm -v`, mine is 6.14.13, if not working then consider installing the package manager using `npm -i`.

Installing npm without arguments i.e. using `npm i` only will install the packages chosen inside your package.JSON file, if a specific package is needed `npm install <package name>` must be used, a package named jshint will be installed using `npm install jshint` for example will install the package locally (for a specific directory) if needed globaly use `npm install -g <package name>` .

Now that we have known what is node and how to use it, lets see **when** to use it:

1. Install packages and testing JS.

2. Controling server requests and events efficiently.

3. Automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC.

4. Design you own command tool.
