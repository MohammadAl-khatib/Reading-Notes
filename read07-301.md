# REST

Roy Fielding, a computer scientist, and one of the principal creators of HTTP, a protocal defines the location of resources on the internet. These resources have an archetictural style called REST (Representational State Transfer) which in turn provides a standard for representing resources and make them exchangable between different systems.

Resources, in general, are representd in a huamn friendly way, machines were not meant to talk to each other, but as the number of formats is increasing, and there have been a rising need for systems interaction and sharing resources.

When it comes to machines, a smaller number of 'word' are needed for that interaction, machines need to locate data resources (URLs) and maybe tell other machines what to do with those resources, these 'to-do's are mainly getting data (**GET**), add or post data (**POST**), put data(**PUT**),delete data (**DELETE**), and partially update data (**PATCH**).
