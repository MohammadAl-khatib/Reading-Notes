## List Comprehensions

List comprehension is the use of some expression inside square braces `[]` to produce lists, it is a faster and more readable way for creating lists.

    
        list = [expression for item in list]
**Examples:**

1. Creating list with `range`:
   
    digits = [x for x in range(10)]

    print(digits)

    Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

2. Multiplying Parts of a List:

    multiples_of_three = [ x*3 for x in range(10) ]

    print(multiples_of_three)

    Output = [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27]

3. Show the first letter of each word using Python:

    authors = ["Ernest Hemingway","Langston Hughes","Frank Herbert","Toni Morrison",
    "Emily Dickson","Stephen King"]

    letters = [ name[0] for name in authors ]

    print(letters)

    Output = ['E', 'L', 'F', 'T', 'E', 'S']

4. Adding condition to pick from lists:

    user_data = "Elvis Presley 987-654-3210"

    phone_number = [ x for x in user_data if x.isdigit()]

    print(phone_number)

    Output: ['9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1', '0']

Different types of functions and conditions can be applied to the item and after list.
