### What is CSS?
CSS stands for cascading style sheets, and as the name implies, it is a styling language turning a boring web page created using only a markup languages (HTML, SVG, or XML) into a better looking, pleasing to the eye page.

CSS syntaxes can be added to the document in 3 different ways:

1.	In line: inserting the syntax inside the tags of HTML.
2.	Internal: inserting the syntax in the head of the document
3.	External: inserting the syntax in an external file and linking it to the document

### CSS Color Property
Selecting the color of is an example of page styling is, anyway, other styling options are similar but with different syntax (you can explore more on w3schools).

For setting the color of a text you can use:
-	style="color:blue; for in line styling
-	h1 {color: blue;} for internal styling
-	h1 {
  color: green;
} in external styling
