## Shutil

This library is used to deal with files, with high level operations like copying and archiving, here is a list of some methods and their use:

Method | Description
------------ | -------------
`copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])` | Copy the contents of the file-like object fsrc to the file-like object fdst
`copyfile(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)` | Copy the contents (no metadata) of the file named src to a file named dst and return dst in the most efficient way possible
`copymode(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)` | Copy the permission bits from src to dst
`copystat(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)` | Copy the permission bits, last access time, last modification time, and flags from src to dst.
`copy(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)` | Copies the file src to the file or directory dst

In order to use this library you will mostly need other libraries like `glob`, `io`, `os`, and `sys`, the [resource](https://pymotw.com/3/shutil/) article contains description with a higher level technical language.

## Automation Ideas
The following link shows how Python can use libraries like `watchdog` to do automated processes like moving files from one pfolder to another and renaming them, or automatically open Youtube when a channel uploads new video.
