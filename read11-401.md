# Data Analysis

## What is Jupyter Lab

Jupyter notebooks are new ways to work easily with data and code together, Jupyter lab will make you interact with [Jupyter project](https://jupyter.org/) through a user interface that starts in commandÂ mode consists of cell that accepts [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) if edit mode entered using `m` letter, or `Python3` if entered using `y` letter.

## Numpy Tutorial

> Numpy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.

**Creating A NumPy Array**:

1. Import Numpy
2. Pass the list of lists to `np.array`

**Using NumPy To Read In Files**:

1. Use the genfromtxt function to read in the winequality-red.csv file.
2. Specify the keyword argument delimiter=";" so that the fields are parsed properly.
3. Specify the keyword argument skip_header=1 so that the header row is skipped.

For indexing, you need 2 indexes because you deal with 2D arrays
