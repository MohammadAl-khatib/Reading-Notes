Sometimes we learn from others, sometimes others learn from us, we might be the lesson or we will be watching a lesson, thatâ€™s how life works. As challenges are a basic part of life, we might face them with one of the following mentalities:

- growth mindset
- fixed mindsets

A fixed mindset is a dynamic, healthy, and more realistic way for dealing with day to day challenges, and is vital for work and overall life success. The fixed mindset, on the other hand, is focused on relaxing and chilling, and dependent on inherent qualities alone.

But what are the major characteristics and differences of both mindsets? Well, here is a short list:
1.	Growth mindset embraces challenges, while fixed mindset avoids them.
2.	Growth mindset learns from criticism, while fixed mindset ignores them.
3.	Growth mindset tries the best to overcome obstacles, while fixed mindset loses focus with them.

How to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
- get out your comfort zone
- focus on your goals and work hard
- try, try, and try
