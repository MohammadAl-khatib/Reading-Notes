## nosql vs sql

No doubt the size of data used or transfered is becoming larger and larger every day, it is estimated that "There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day at our current pace, but that pace is only accelerating with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT). Over the last two years alone 90 percent of the data in the world was generated" according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=2b8f2eb860ba), dealing with such amount of data is not only challenging, but also defines the way the internet will look like in future.

For grouping or arranging data there are alot of data base, most known are MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB, which can be divided into two main categories:

1. SQL (structured query language)

2. NoSQL

The main focus of this article is on the differences and use cases of each type, the folowing table summarizes our topic:

Property | SQL | NoSQL
------------ | ------------ | -------------
General | realtional databases | non realtional data bases
data style | tables | JSON,graphs, documents
schema | predefined | dynamic
scalability | vertical | horizontal
schema | predefined | dynamic
language | structured query language | varies
examples | MySql,Oracle | MOngoDB, Hbase

Other mentions are that Nosql is better for big data and hierarchical data representation, while SQL is better for non hierarchical and high demand for updating data, NoSQL is faster when it comes to reading and even regular writing of data, SQL is best fit for data when it comes to updating as mentioned earlier.
