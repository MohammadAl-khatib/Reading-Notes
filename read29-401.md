# Django Custom User
## AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
Dealing with AbstractBaseUser is much harder than dealing with AbstractUser, and it is not recommended unless you are an expert, in this article we will deal with AbstractUser wich is a subclass of AbstractBaseUser.

To create custom user, these are the main steps:
- update config/settings.py
- create a new CustomUser model
- create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
- update the admin

Written code for those steps can be found [here](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model), we can now create  super user to check the result, Django-x also can be used, it comes with a built in custom user model.
