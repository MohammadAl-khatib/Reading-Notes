# Putting it all together

*Here are the main steps of building a React App:*

1. **Define Component Hierarchy:**

   - Divide the page into components where each part of the page to do a specific task is considered a seprate component (kown as single responsibility principle), when a component is growing too big, it is good to think of dividing it to sub components.

2. **Build A Static Version in React:**

   - Where you will have a model of your design but with no interactivity.

3. **Identify Interactive Data**

   - As long as needed, data needed for interaction will be stored in `state` not `props`.

4. **Where to Add State?**

   - Data needed for a component shall live in it or on a higher level component (remeber one way data flow)

5. **Data Flow in Opposit Direction**

   - Define what kind of interaction needed from child to parent and pass functions that `setState` as aprop to the child.
