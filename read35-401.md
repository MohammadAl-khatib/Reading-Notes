A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Types of graphs:
1. Directed:
    Here nodes points to other nodes with directoion

2. Undirected:
    No direction for the links between the nodes (the edges)

3. Complete:
    Each node points to all other nodes

4. Connected:
    Each node has a link or more to other nodes

5. Disconnected:
    Some nodes cannot be connected to some other nodes

6. Acyclic:
    No path (i.e. a set of links) can lead back to the same node

7. Cyclic:
    Some paths (i.e. a set of links) can lead back to the same node
