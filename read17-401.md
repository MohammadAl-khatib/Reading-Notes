# Web Scraping
Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites, keeping in mind that not all websites are open for this data sharing.

**Steps:**
1. Inspect the website
2. Import the following libraries: requests, urllib.request, time, and BeautifulSoup
3. Use `requests.get(url)` to get the data from the required url
4. Parse data using `BeautifulSoup(response.text, “html.parser”)`
5. Use `time.sleep()`, and set time as argument, so the website will not recognize you as spammer

### How to Scrape Websites Without Getting Blocked
- Respect scraping rules of the site
- Don't over scrape data (slam the website with a lot)
- Act like real human
