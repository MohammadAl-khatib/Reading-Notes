With CSS3 came new ways to add styling to HTML elements, these ways will not just affect the shape of the element but will also add animation both in 2D and 3D transform, the most common styles are shown in the table below:

Property | description
------------ | -------------
`Rotate` | rotates an object around its center
`Scale` | enlarge or contract image
`Translate` | reposition element relative to its location
`Skew` | distort an element
`Transition` | sets time for changing one style to another

The origin at which styling takes place can be changed from 50% 50% which represents the center of the elemnt and is the default value to any required value.

* Some prefixes are used in case the browser does not support transform properties like `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, and `-o-`.

The image below displays some of these properties
